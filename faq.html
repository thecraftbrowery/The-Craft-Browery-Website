                    Make sure you read this thoroughly! All of it is very important. Following
                    the correct aftercare procedure will ensure that you keep your brows beautiful. Failure to follow these instructions may
                    result in pigment loss, discoloration, scarring, and infections.

                    Every few hours after the appointment, make sure to blot with a clean tissue or paper towel to remove
                    excess lymph and blood particles to prevent scabbing.

                    For the first microblading session, the entire procedure should take about 2.5 - 3 hours. During this
                    session, the brow artist will measure and shape the clientâ€™s brows, then check with the client for approval.
                    Then, the pigment color is selected and agreed upon with the client. Next, your brows are numbed for about
                    10 - 15 minutes before the procedure begins. For more detailed steps on the procedure, click
                    <a href="process.html">here</a>.

                <p>
                    The second touch-up microblading session takes place after 4-6 weeks after the initial session, as a "perfection"
                    session to address any discrepancies with shape, color, or any other minor issues.
                    This session will take approximately 1.5 - 2 hours to complete.

                    It takes about 14 days for the basic healing to be over, and about a month for the brows and color
                    to go completely back to normal. After 4-6 weeks the client can come back for the touch-up session.

                    Of course everyone's pain tolerance is different, but generally speaking the pain level is mild to none.
                    I personally consider myself to have a low pain tolerance and it was not a problem for me at all!
                    Before any needles touch the skin, a topical anesthetic will be applied to the area for 10 - 15 minutes
                    to numb the area. Anesthetics may contain lidocaine, prilocaine, benzocaine, tetracaine and epinephrine.
                    A little redness and swelling in the area after the procedure is normal.

                    After the first 14 days you can resume most of your normal activities. For the most long lasting results,
                    continue avoiding things like chemical peels and sun exposure (use sunscreen!) to the brow area. Anything that damages
                    or removes the skin will also damage or remove the pigment in that skin and cause it to fade faster.

                    Microblading typically lasts 1 - 3 years, depending on many factors. Despite being called
                    "cosmetic tattoos", microblading pigments are not implanted as deeply as traditional
                    tattoos (if they are, they can turn blue or red and need color correction!). The client's skin type,
                    skincare routine, and sun exposure will all have an effect on color retention.

                    Prior to your procedure, clients are advised to do the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>

                    <li>
                        Avoid chemicals or harsh exfoliants for two weeks prior
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Please DO come in with your brow makeup so the artist can see your preferred brow shape. Reference
                        pictures of the brow shape and color you desire are also good to bring.

                    These rules are for the client's safety, and are required by the insurance company. The client will need to sign

                    All risks and complications are minimized by state and county law mandating licensing of the permanent

                    Although allergic reaction to pigments are rare, it could be possible for some clients. We suggest a pigment
