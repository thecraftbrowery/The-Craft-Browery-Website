                <p>
                    Before you make your appointment, I will talk with you via text or email to determine
                    if you are a good candidate for a permanent makeup procedure. This will include asking for
                    a clear picture of your brows without makeup, and a short health questionnaire. If you have
                    not read through the <a href="faq.html">FAQ page</a>, go there first for a better idea
                    of what this will look like. If you have many allergies or extremely sensitive skin,
                    we can book a short complimentary patch test before booking your main appointment.

                </header>
                <p>
                    On the day of your appointment when you first arrive, we will discuss your wishes and desires
                    for your brows. You are encouraged to come in your brow makeup if you usually wear it, and
                    to bring pictures of your #browgoals (Keep in mind I do customize your brows to your facial
                    bones). If we have not already discussed it in pre-screening, we will determine which type of
                    brow service will be best for you. Next, you will fill out all the consent forms and paperwork,
                    then move on to taking 'before' pictures.
                </p>

                    <h2>Brow Mapping</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    This is the most important part, and can account for up to 50% of your appointment time!
                    Using specialty rulers and waxed thread, I will measure and draw an outline of the shape
                    of your brows based on your facial features. The goal is to create the desired shape as
                    symmetrical as possible within the confines of your facial features to enhance your natural beauty
                    (Remember though, your brows are sisters, not twins).
                    Once the brows are mapped, I will take pictures once again, and provide you with a mirror to
                    give approval on the shape, making tweaks if needed.
                </p>

                    <h2>Main Procedure</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    This is the fun part! First, I will apply a numbing cream to your eyebrows to ensure
                    there will be minimal pain during the procedure. This will sit for about 10 minutes before
                    we start the treatment. During this waiting period, I will do a color match with the pigment
                    to your brow hair, which I will once again get your approval on before we continue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the procedure, no matter which service we chose to go with, multiple passes will be
                    needed to get the proper color retention. If you start to feel any pain, we can add additional
                    numbing cream between passes if necessary.
                </p>
            </div>

                    <p>Step Five</p>
                    <h2>Post-Procedure</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    After the treatment is complete, I will take 'after' photos and your new brows will be
                    revealed to you! We can address any minimal touchups at this point if necessary, but
                    after the multi-step approval process that shouldn't be needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The color will be darker and bolder than you will expect it to be, remember that it
                    heals 30-50% lighter. Redness, blanching (whiteness around the area), and swelling
                    are all normal for immediately after the procedure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will go over the <a href="aftercare.html">aftercare instructions</a> with you
                    to make sure you understand the healing process and what to expect at each stage
                    before I send you home with your amazing new brows.
                </p>

                    <h2>Touch-up</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    6-8 weeks after your initial treatment was completed, you can come in for a touch-up
                    appointment. Here we will address color, color retention, and shape. This is also a good time
                    to add on shading if you previously only received Microblading and you want a more
                    contrasting result.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Touch-up appointments will NOT be allowed before the 6 week mark. You must trust the
                    healing process and let your skin do it's thing. Additionally, touch-up appointments
                    booked after the 8 week mark will incur a late fee charge.
