                    Make sure you read this thoroughly! By booking an appointment you agree to all policies of The Craft Browery.
                    These rules are put in place for both of our safety. Thank you for understanding.

                <p>
                    Before scheduling an appointment, a picture of your brows must be sent via text or email to evaluate if you are
                    a suitable candidate for a service. In many cases, removal is needed before more color is added. Sometimes
                    additional color correction sessions are needed even after that. I reserve the
                    right to refuse service to any potential client for any reason.

                </header>
                <p>
                    A non-refundable deposit of $50 is required to reserve your appointment. This deposit will apply towards
                    the value of your service. If you are late or no-show to your appointment, the full deposit will be forfeited.
                    If you cancel your appointment at any time or any reason, the full deposit will be forfeited.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Deposits are paid with Paypal or email invoice via Paypal (thecraftbrowery@gmail.com for both) and must
                    be paid to hold any appointment.

                    Your service must be paid in total on the day of your appointment. Cash, Paypal, and card are the accepted forms of payment.
                    The Craft Browery does not accept personal checks or partial payments. Your final payment amount will be the total cost of the
                    appointment minus any previous deposit that was paid.

                </header>
                <p>
                    The Craft Browery requires at least 72 hours notice to make any changes to your appointment. You may only reschedule ONCE
                    before forfeiting your deposit. You may reschedule by text or email at least 72 hours before your scheduled appointment
                    time. Any reschedules or cancellations after that will result in a loss of your deposit. You will have to pay another
                    deposit if you still wish to receive services and may be subject to rescheduling fee, or loss of service entirely. I reserve the
                    right to refuse service to any potential client for any reason.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No-shows will result in a loss of your deposit. You will have to pay another

                    and may be subject to rescheduling fee, or loss of service entirely. I reserve the
                    right to refuse service to any potential client for any reason.

                    There will be absolutely NO refunds for any reason. By booking an appointment you agree to all policies,

                    Please arrive to your appointment on time. If you are more than 10 minutes late, I reserve the right to
                    cancel your appointment and your deposit will not be refunded.

                <p>
                    Permanent makeup results are not guaranteed on anyone. It is an art, not a science.
                    The final result will vary from person to person. Makeup
                    may still be needed to give you the results you desire. Sometimes, more than one touch up session is necessary.
