                    There are many different styles of permanent makeup you can receive for your brows, with many different types of names!
                    Here is the personal terminology I use to try to clear up some of the confusion. When requesting your service with any
                    permanent makeup artist, make sure that you are on the same page with your artist, and include pictures of your desired outcome.
                    We want you to be happy and look your best!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Microblading is one of the most common terms used for modern brow tattooing. It's probably how you learned about permanent makeup!
                    Microblading is a technique done with a manual tool and fine needles to create hair-like strokes to add volume and texture to enhance the brows shape.
                    It works best for people with no previous permanent makeup, and people with non-oily skin. Oily skin can cause the strokes to become blurry.
                    It typically lasts 1-3 years depending on your skin and how well you care for them. Many people get them touched up annually.

                <p>
                    Combination brows can also be called Microblading + Shading, because it is a combination of two techniques.
                    The front of the brow will have the fine hair strokes that are characteristic of Microblading, while the tail
                    of the brow will be darker and more defined. First, a normal microblading procedure is performed. Then, shading is added
                    which can be accomplished with manual shading for a softer look, or with machine shading, which will end up looking more like makeup.

                    Powder Brows are also referred to as Ombré, Soft Edge, Soft, Pixel, Instagram etc.
                    They are intended to give a more filled-in makeup look.
                    Powder Brows are done with a machine and leave a light to dark ombré,
                    which can be lighter at the front and/or top of the brows and going darker towards the tail, based on the client's preference.

                <p>
                    Henna brows are a great way to try out the way permanent makeup will look before going through with the actual procedure.
                    Think of it as a test run for Powder Brows. Henna uses a natural dye to stain the skin and hair for about 2-3 weeks.

                    This is your perfection session! It is not required, but it is recommended to come back between 6-8 weeks
                    after your initial appointment for a touchup session so I can address color retention and shape of the client's healed brows
                    to make sure you are perfectly happy. It is also a good time to add shading if the microblading healed lighter than
                    desired.
